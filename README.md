Odin-Recipes
Description

Odin-Recipes is a simple project developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to reinforce and apply fundamental web development concepts, specifically focusing on HTML. This project demonstrates my ability to structure and organize content effectively by creating a basic recipe website. It serves as a hands-on exercise to solidify my understanding of HTML elements, linking between pages, and file organization.
