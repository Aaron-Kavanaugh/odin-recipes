    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp Real bacon bits</li>
        <li>1 lb Ground beef</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tsp Sweet relish</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Sea salt</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Rye bread</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ground beef, bacon bits, onion powder, black pepper, sea salt, and sugar. Mix thoroughly and form into patties that match the size of your bread slices.</li>
        <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat and cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your preferred level of doneness.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine ketchup, mayonnaise, and sweet relish to make a tangy burger sauce.</li>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of rye bread. On the non-buttered side of three slices, spread some of the sauce, then place a slice of cheddar cheese, a cooked patty, a slice of provolone cheese, and another slice of bread with the buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Heat a clean skillet over medium heat. Grill each sandwich until the bread is golden and crispy and the cheese is melted, about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
